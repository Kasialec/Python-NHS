# Python-NHS
For this assignment at LSE, I took on the role of a team member contracted by the NHS. My responsibilities involved refining high-level business questions into actionable analytic queries related to service utilization and missed appointments. The project aimed to inform budget allocation and infrastructure expansion based on data insights.

1. I began by conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to investigate key aspects of the datasets. This included analyzing the number of locations, service settings, context types, and appointment statuses, as well as determining the date range of the data.
2. I assessed monthly and seasonal trends in appointment numbers across various service settings and categories, identifying patterns in resource utilization.
3. By examining missed appointments, I aimed to understand their underlying causes, contributing to cost reduction strategies and improved patient engagement.
4. I explored the provided Twitter dataset to identify trending hashtags and assess how social media insights could inform decision-making processes for the NHS.
5. Based on the data analysis, I evaluated whether the current staffing and capacity levels were adequate and provided insights into resource utilization. I formulated actionable recommendations for improving appointment attendance and optimizing the use of existing resources.
